i have been cycling between 2 phases.

i have been bouncing back and forth between those two phases nonstop. i rarely find myself in between. i am either one or the other.

when i am in a productive phase, i just feel like i have endless repetition of energy.
when i am in a productive phase, getting things done just comes easily to me. i sit down, i start working on something and i just immediately click into a flow state and things are just seamless.

when i am in an unproductive state, it is the complete opposite. i procrastinate beyond belief. i feel intimidated to start projects because i am not confident that i will have the brain power to complete them.

i think it is becaue i am physically and mentally exhausted. not because i didn;t get a lot of sleep the night before. but because I just AM and there is no explanation.
